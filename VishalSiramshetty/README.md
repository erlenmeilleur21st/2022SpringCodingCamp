## Machine Learning in Python

In this project we will develop a machine learning model for an endpoint of interest using Python. This involves:

- Programmatically accessing PubChem database (or a similar database,for e.g., ChEMBL) to download drug discovery datasets
- Data preprocessing and calculation of molecular features
- Machine learning to build classification/regression models
- Statistical analyses to assess model performance

**Note**: I am open to work on any project that involves automating data retrieval, data preprocessing, visualization and modeling (classification or regression). Please feel free to propose something different that can help your research work.
