# Specific Project Goals

## C Goals

1. Take a BA DOSY Input
2. Ingest Data
3. Perform DOSY Fit on all Peaks w/ sufficient data
4. Plot DOSY 2D digitized
5. Allow user demarcated "separation"
6. Collect peaks into digital sets representing the species
7. Plot resulting synthetic 1D spectra for separated species

## B Goals
1. Take a 1D digitized spectra and do full coupling analysis
2. match peaks of same J values for multiplets
3. check relative magnitudes of peaks within 24Hz (for 1H)

## A Goals
