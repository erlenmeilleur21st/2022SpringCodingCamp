****Specific Project Goals****
***C Goals***
Take a BA DOSY Input
Ingest Data
Perform DOSY Fit on all Peaks w/ sufficient data
Plot DOSY 2D digitized
Allow user demarcated "separation"
Collect peaks into digital sets representing the species
Plot resulting synthetic 1D spectra for separated species

***B Goals***
Take a 1D digitized spectra and do full coupling analysis
match peaks of same J values for multiplets
check relative magnitudes of peaks within 24Hz (for 1H)

***A Goals***
