Mark Williams (Python or Java):

* Introduction to Python scripting or Java 
* Introduction to IntelliJ development environment
* Automated Unit Testing
* Basic API with Swagger
* Automating database interactions
* Organizing data with Pandas
* Making a text adventure like Zork

Just some examples, Iâ€™m willing to work with any reasonable project or even just some basic learning about coding with toy projects.
